# Welcome to the 2025 Microsoft Agentic AI Labs!

---

This repository contains the hands-on materials for our workshops: **Orchestrating Intelligence: Building Agentic Workflows with Microsoft Fabric**.

Throughout the session, you'll explore how to go from raw data to intelligent workflows by combining:
- **Fabric Data Agents** for governed natural language access to data,
- **Copilot Studio** for contextual, embedded interactions,
- **AI Foundry** for orchestrating multi-step agentic workflows.

## What’s Included

- `Lab 1`: Prepare and Build a Fabric Data Agent
- `Lab 2`: Expose Your Agent via Copilot Studio
- `Lab 3`: Orchestrate Intelligence with AI Foundry

## Theoretical Background

We are entering a new era of AI-powered systems that go far beyond dashboards and reports. Instead of passively consuming static data, users increasingly expect to *ask* questions, receive contextual answers, and initiate *proactive workflows* — all through natural language.

Microsoft’s vision for Agentic AI is rooted in this shift. Through a layered approach — **Fabric** as the unified data foundation, **Fabric Data Agents (FDA)** for structured natural language access, **Copilot Studio** as a low-code platform for building custom copilots that interact with users through natural language, and **AI Foundry** for orchestrated multi-step reasoning — you can build systems that *observe*, *reason*, and *act*. These labs are your first step in turning that vision into practical skills.

You’ll be working hands-on with the technologies that bring this to life: structured data, semantic metadata, AI reasoning interfaces, and workflow orchestration — all designed for responsible and scalable deployment.

## Labs Overview

You’ll participate in a series of progressive labs designed to help you understand and build your own agentic AI systems:

### **Lab 1: Prepare and Build a Fabric Data Agent**
> **Goal:** Create your first Fabric Data Agent that can answer questions from structured Lakehouse or Warehouse data.

You’ll learn how to:
- Build and configure a Fabric Data Agent using Microsoft Fabric
- Connect the agent to Lakehouse data and guide its behavior with natural language
- Improve query accuracy through examples and schema-aware design
- Debug and refine the agent’s SQL output using real test questions

Please see inside [**lab1**](./lab1/) for the full lab materials.

### **Lab 2: Expose Your Agent via Copilot Studio** *(Coming Soon)*
> **Goal:** Use Copilot Studio to create a user-facing experience that interacts with your Fabric Data Agent.

Topics will include:
- Connecting your agent into a Copilot Studio flow
- Triggering agent responses from UI components
- Guardrails and security best practices

### **Lab 3: Orchestrate Intelligence with AI Foundry** *(Coming Soon)*
> **Goal:** Build a multi-step intelligent system that chains together agents and APIs using Foundry.

You’ll learn:
- What AI Foundry is and how it works
- How to combine FDA, logic, APIs, and prompts
- How to deploy and test an end-to-end reasoning chain
